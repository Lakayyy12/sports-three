    <string name="bg5">Playing wisely is the best method to make money at a casino.

Instead, play $1 spins to stretch out your gaming sessions and make them more interesting. Playing $1 spins gives you 50 chances to win cash, whilst playing $10 spins gives you only 5 chances to win money.</string>
    <string name="bg6">Random number generators (RNGs) are used by online casinos and their software to ensure that every card dealt and every spin of the reels is fully determined by chance. Don not become superstitious because you can not change the outcome of a game. Simply sit back and take advantage of the cash-grabbing possibilities as they arise.</string>

That is why you should never play at a casino that has been banned. Check out our list of real money casinos for guaranteed security.</string>
    <string name="bg10">Although it may appear obvious, alcohol and gambling do not mix well. Having a drink before or during your game at any casino may hamper your decision-making abilities, and you may end up spending money you should not. Do not drink and gamble.</string>


    <string name="sbt1">The first thing oddsmakers do when they post a betting line for a game is identify which team should be the favorite and which should be the underdog.The favorite is predicted to win the game and will have a minus sign next to its odds, whilst the underdog is likely to lose and will have a plus sign next to its odds. If the game is a toss-up, the book will open with "pick" or "pick'em."</string>
    <string name="sbt2">There are two primary methods for betting on a favorite or an underdog. The first is a bet on the margin of victory, known as the point spread.
Assume the Patriots are 7 point favorites over the Jets. They be listed at  7. If you bet on the Patriots, they must win by 8 points or more in order for you to win your wager. If the Patriots win by 8 points or more, you cover, and if the Patriots win by exactly 7 points, you push, which means you get your money back.</string>
    <string name="sbt4">Oddsmakers will set a total number of points scored in a game by both teams combined, as well as a favorite and underdog line. This is known as the total or over/under.
Bettors can then place bets on whether the game will finish Over or Under the total.</string>
    <string name="sbt3">The moneyline is the second option for betting on a favorite or an underdog. The payoff is determined purely by which team wins the game and is calculated using American odds.
Favorites are once again designated with a "negative," such as -150, -200, or -500. If a favorite is -200, it indicates you must risk $200 in order to gain $100. If the favorite wins, you receive $100; if the favorite loses, you lose $200.
Because favorites are expected to win, betting on them carries a higher level of risk.</string>
    <string name="sbt5">Finally, you have the last decision on how much to bet on a game, but a decent rule of thumb is to risk no more than you can afford to lose. Sports betting is a long-distance race, not a sprint. There will be days when everything goes right and days when everything goes wrong. As a result, we advocate for a flat-betting strategy.
This entails betting the same amount on each game and risking only 1% to 5% of your bankroll per play (the bankroll is the starting amount you have at your disposal to bet with). For example, if you have a $100 bankroll, you should risk no more than $5 per game.</string>

    <string name="tp4">Examine a team is in record against the spread.(click)</string>
    <string name="tp04">ATS, which stands for against the spread, is a popular stat you will see a lot.
It is incredibly useful to understand how teams perform not only in the win/loss column, but also against the point spread set by casinos and sportsbooks. Consider the point spread as a supplemental struggle for teams when it comes to gambling.</string>
    <string name="tp5">Follow Winning Streaks (click)</string>
    <string name="tp05">In sports, team and individual performance can be extremely volatile. Some players are in the zone and can not miss a shot, while others are as cold as ice. You may profit from hot and cold streaks in your betting, and if you can see them faster than the oddsmakers, you will have a significant advantage.</string>

    <string name="history">Publications about statistical models for football predictions began in the 1990s, but the first model was proposed much earlier by Moroney, who published his first statistical analysis of soccer match results in 1956. According to his analysis, both the Poisson distribution and the negative binomial distribution provided an adequate fit to football game results. Reep and Benjamin, successfully used negative binomial distribution to examine the series of ball passing between players during football matches in 1968. They modified this strategy in 1971, and Hill demonstrated in 1974 that soccer game outcomes can be predicted and are not only determined by chance.</string>

    <string name="history1">Michael Maher created the first model for forecasting the outcomes of football matches between teams of varying ability levels in 1982. The goals scored by the opponents during the game are drawn from the Poisson distribution, according to his hypothesis. The model parameters are established by the differential in offensive and defensive skills, which is adjusted for home field advantage. In a 1992 publication, Caurneya and Carron discussed the methodologies for modeling the home field advantage factor. Knorr-Held investigated the time-dependence of team strengths in 1999. He rated football teams using recursive Bayesian estimate, which was more realistic than soccer prediction based on conventional average data.</string>
